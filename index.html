                    <p>
                        DIRK MANNING is best known as the writer/creator of horror comic series such as the TALES OF MR. RHEE, NIGHTMARE WORLD, and LOVE STORIES (TO DIE FOR). Dirk is also the author of the ongoing inspirational column/book collection WRITE OR WRONG: A WRITER'S GUIDE TO CREATING COMICS. More of Dirk’s gripping and exciting stories can be read in comic titles such as HOPE, TWIZTID’S HAUNTED HIGH-ONS, and THE ADVENTURES OF CTHULHU JR. & DASTARDLY DIRK (Source Point Press), THE LEGEND OF OZ: THE WICKED WEST and URSA MINOR (Big Dog Ink), and LEGEND OF THE SHADERS (with The Harp Twins). Dirk has also had short stories in numerous anthologies, including Riley Rossmo’s DIA DE LOS MUERTOS (Image Comics) and more.
                        Dirk has also written short films for the horror film anthology series BLACKBOX TV (YouTube Red) and prose stories the RPG series CLOCKWORK: DOMINION (Reliquary Game Studios) He has also quickly become one of the most groundbreaking and noteworthy comic creators on Kickstarter, with presales of over $250,000 and counting on the crowdfunding platform, setting new records for his publishers.
                        Don't let Dirk’s penchant for writing horror comics and his tongue-in-cheek publicity photo with the black hat and scarf fool you, as he’s a very amicable and approachable creator who’s known as one of the “must visit” creators in Artist Alley across the convention circuit. Dirk always has copies of his work with him at his table – and book signings/photos are always free!
                        Whether you’re a fan of emotionally engaging stories with great art or you’re an aspiring creator looking for advice regarding how to “break-in” to the comic industry, your experience at the convention won’t be complete without stopping by Dirk Manning’s table to chat with him and becoming familiar with his work. When not on the road Dirk lives on the Internet and can be found online at www.DirkManning.com as well as at Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr @dirkmanning.
