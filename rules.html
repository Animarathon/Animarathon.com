happy for all of our guests. In general the rules simply ask you to do two things.</p>

  <p>That's why we're promising you two things in return.</p>
  <h3>改善</h3>
  <p>Our first promise to you is 改善 (Kaizen).</p>
  <p>Kaizen is the Japanese process of continuous improvement.</p>
  <p>That means that Animarathon will reflect itself continuously.</p>
  <p>To the benefit of itself and the community around it.</p>
  <h3>A Good Time</h3>
  <p>Our Second, but equally important promise to you is a good time.</p>
  <p>You've earned it.</p>
