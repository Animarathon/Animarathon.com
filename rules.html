                <b>-----</b><b>When should I wear my badge?</b>

                <p>
                    While at Animarathon you are encouraged to wear your badge at all times, so it is not lost on accident!

                    However, you might want to remove your badge for photoshoots or other reasons. If you do remove your badge take care not to loose your badge! Animarathon can't replace lost or missing badges!

                <br />
                <b>-----</b><b>Why does Animarathon cost money?</b>

                <p>
                    While BGSU does help us with many functions, they can not be expected pay for everything. BGSU is an academic institution, and we wouldn't have it any other way.

                    Renting out rooms, printing badges and brochures, purchasing food and drink, inviting special guests, and hiring Police all costs money. When it's all said and done the costs to hold Animarathon are in the ballpark of about $30,000 each year. That might seem like a large number, but it would be way larger if it weren't for the generous help of the Bowling Green community.

                    In past years we were able to cover our costs with raffle tickets and bake sales, however as Animarathon grew, some years were were unable to recoup our costs using this method. In order to guarantee our ability to keep hosting Animarathons we had to start charging a modest admission fee.

                    Keeping Animarathon accessible to everyone is important to us, so we do our best to keep the admission prices at about the price of a fancy meal. Please keep in mind that other conventions may often charge more then $30 for admission. To make Animarathon truly accesible to all, we also give anyone who volunteers for two hours or more each day free admission!

                <br />Attendees who are disruptive or breath the rules kill the mood, and may be asked to leave without a refund based on a staff member's decision.

            </p><p>
                <br />Possible punishments for rule breaking could include one or more of the following:

            </p><p>

            </p><p>
                <br /><b>Being placed on a permanent blacklist, unable to return to Animarathon in the future. This list will include your reason for exclusion. We may share this list with other conventions in the future.</b>
            </p><p>
                <br /><b>Paying for any damage caused.</b>

            <p>
                Thank you for reading this far! Seriously, great job!
            </p><p>
                <br />
                We don't expect you to follow our rules for nothing.
            </p><p>
                <br />
                That's why we're promising you two things in return.

            <p>
                Our first promise to you is 改善 (Kaizen).
            </p><p>
                <br />
                Kaizen is the Japanese process of continuous improvement.

                <br />
                That means that Animarathon will reflect itself continuously.
            </p><p>
                <br />
                To the benefit of itself and the community around it.
