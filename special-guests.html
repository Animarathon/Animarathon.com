 <h3>Vocaloid IA</h3>
  	<div style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;">
   	<img src="./media/media_nonfree/special-guests/2019-IA.png" alt="img" width="275" height="300"/>
 </div>
    <div style="display:inline-block;">
        <div> IA is a virtual artist who has a voice with the VOCALOID 3 library (IA -ARIA ON THE PLANETES and IA ROCKS)
         and with the CeVIO library (IA English). Since she was born as a virtual artist in 2012, she has been collaborating
        with various artists such as TeddyLoid and Jin on projects such as the Kagerou Project.
        Her first live concert in North America was in July 2015, at the Los Angeles Anime Expo, in front of a 
        sold-out crowd of two thousand. Since then it's been nothing but great news from this vocaloid with a  
        world tour in cities such as New York; London; Shanghai; Hong Kong; Mexico City; San Jose, Costa Rica; Melbourne;
        Montreal; Santiago, Chile; and Madrid.</div>
        <br />
        <div>  Please come support IA's Animarathon debut.  </div>
        <div>  This year we will be showing a film concert, and afterwards there will be a special IA merchandise raffle for the first 40 people to fill out this survey! https://goo.gl/forms/nH8HYKunyah6nY4K2</div>

</div>
<div style="display:inline-block;">
    <div>
        "Hard Decora is an apparel and illustration brand that promotes aggressive individuality. Kamilah Jones started Hard Decora in 2014 after being inspired by a single photo 
        on Tumblr of a fairy kei girl carrying a pastel gun. What if there was Harajuku fashion girl gang that could stand up for themselves? and that's not so far out of the realm 
        of reality because when we wear these bold clothes we are challenging the status quo by just existing. However, a lot of us keep our greatest expression to ourselves. 
        That's why Hard Decora creates work that does the defending for you."
    </div>
    <div>
        Kamilah Jones will be bringing their brand to Animarathon as well as hosting j-fashion related panels throughout the weekend! Kamilah will also be one of our special guests for the Lolita Tea Party.

            However regardless of style, Puvithel's items are loud,inspired by the in-your-face aesthetic of American goth fashion.
            Expression in the form of fashion can help people, and Puvithel tries to express that idea in each item. 
            Every series has its own style and narrative to aid you in telling your own story."
