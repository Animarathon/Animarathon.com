  <h1>Macabre Maestro: Dirk Manning</h1>
  <img src="./media/media_nonfree/special-guests/2014-dirk-manning.jpg" alt="Dirk Manning reaching out to you." style="width:100%"/>
  <p><strong>Dirk Manning</strong> is best known as the writer/creator of comic series such as the “Cthulhu Noir” <strong>TALES OF MR. RHEE</strong> and the enthralling horror anthology series <strong>NIGHTMARE WORLD</strong> and <strong>Love Stories (To Die For)</strong>, all released by Devil’s Due Publishing.

Dirk has also written short films for the horror film anthology series <strong>BLACKBOX TV</strong> (YouTube) and prose stories the RPG series <strong>Clockwork: Dominion</strong> (Reliquary Game Studios). Dirk always has copies of his work with him at his table – and autographs/book signings are always free!</p>
  <p>Don't let Dirk’s penchant for writing horror comics and his tongue-in-cheek publicity photo with the black hat and scarf fool you, as he’s a very amicable and approachable creator who’s known as one of the “must visit” creators in Artist Alley across the convention circuit. Whether you’re a fan of well-executed horror or an aspiring creator looking for advice regarding how to “break-in” to the comic industry, your experience at the convention won’t be complete without stopping by Dirk Manning’s table to chat with him and become familiar with his work. When not on the road Dirk lives on the Internet and can be found online at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dirkmanning.com/">www.DirkManning.com</a> as well as at Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr @dirkmanning.</p>
