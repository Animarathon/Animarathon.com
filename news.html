              <p>On Saturday, there will be a religious fundamentalist group holding an event in another building on campus. Due to the questionable content that will be covered during their event, there has been some concern among the convention heads that the convention attendees may run in to some issues.</p>
              <p>There is nothing we can do to prevent them from holding their event or from coming in to the Union for food, which would be the only reason they would need to be in our convention space. By the school's rules, we cannot forbid students from doing student-y things, and we cannot forbid people from eating in the convention space if they are not part of said con. </p>
              <p>That being said, if these people do come to the con, we ask that you treat them with courtesy, or just ignore them altogether. Do not start fights, and do not respond to any heckling. If there is any situation that arises, please get security, either convention security, Union staff (wearing black Union shirts and khakis), or the police officer roaming the halls to call it to a stop.</p>
              <p>This counts for if a convention-goer starts something, or if a member of the religious group starts something.</p>
              <p>I don't expect, and in fact I hope that everyone just respects the boundaries and goes about their day peacefully, that anything should happen, but the other convention heads and myself wanted to give a heads up that there could be a conflict. Just as with Ohayocon having to deal with the cheerleading competitions and the religious conventions at the same time, we have to respect the others.</p>
              <p>Anyone found not doing so can and will be immediately removed from the Union and the convention as a whole.</p>
              <p>Thank you. </p>
