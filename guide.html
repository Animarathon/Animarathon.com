  <h1 id="">Animarathon Guide!</h1>
  <p>Is Animarathon your first Anime Convention? This guide might be able to help you get the most out of your experience!</p>
  <h2 id="preparation">Getting Ready</h2>
  <p>Congratulations on your decision to attend an Anime Convention! It's important that you get lots of sleep the night before, shower in the morning, use deodorant, and eat a big hearty breakfast before coming to Animarathon.</p>
  <p>If you're bringing any electronics with you bringing your own charger will guarantee you'll be able to keep using them well into the night! Most Smart Phones won't last through Animarathon, especially if you're taking photographs or video with them so don't forget it!</p>
  <p>Transfer photos on your camera or cell phone to your computer before Animarathon! You'll need the space!</p>
  <p>If you're driving by car, make sure to fill up your tank with enough gas before you start your trip!</p>
  <p>If you're paying in cash, you would be our hero if you came with exact change. Not only does this get you to the con faster, it makes the volunteers happier then you could imagine.</p>
  <h2 id="badge">Getting your badge</h2>
  <p>If you preregistered you'll want to get into the preregistration line. Otherwise you'll want to get in the general registration line.</p>
  <p>If you have a smartphone you should consider visiting the Animarathon website and looking at the schedule. Create reminders for any events or panels that you don't want to miss.</p>
  <p>Alternatively when you get your schedule, you should get out a pen and mark the panels and events you would like to attend for sure.</p>
  <p>Once you get your badge, make sure to grab a lanyard and wear it at all times. Animarathon can't issue replacement badges, so please treat your badge with care. It recommended that for any guest, and required for children guests, to write your contact information on the back, just in case it is lost or you have an emergency.</p>
  <h2 id="etiquette">Convention Etiquette</h2>
  <p>When everyone observes proper etiquette conventions are a lot more enjoyable!</p>
  <p>In general just being nice and courteous to people is all you really need. If you follow the Animarathon Rules, you shouldn't have any problems here!</p>
  <p>Another important tip is to raise your hand when you want to talk in panels, unless the speaker indicates otherwise.</p>
  <p>Less obvious ways to practice good etiquette include not congregating in the center of hallways, saving elevators for the disabled to use, and keeping photoshoots off to the side.</p>
  <h2 id="photos">Taking Photos</h2>
  <p>You will almost certainly see a cosplay or some other cool thing that you'll want to take a picture of. Animarathon encourages you to bring a camera and take as many pictures as you want with subject permission. Most people will be happy to have their picture taken, and many will even pose for you if you ask them too. That said, if someone doesn't want their photograph taken, respect their wishes.</p>
  <p>When taking photos, look around for things that might make interesting backgrounds or other ways to enhance the picture. Don't forget that distance from your subject and perspective makes a difference!
  <p>It may be tempting to shake the sakura blossoms off the cherry trees outside for your photoshoot, but you really shouldn't. Most of the time the effect is not as dramatic as the photographer wants it to be, and shaking the blossoms off makes hurts the Cherry Blossom festival later in the year. Please help share Japanese culture with everyone, and leave the trees as a backdrop for your photos only </p>
  <h2 id="eat">Eat Up!</h2>
  <p>There are plenty of options to eat on campus, including Animarathon's Kawaii Kaf√©. There is also the Falcon's Nest on the first floor, alongside a coffee shop and the Black Swamp Pub.</p>
  <p>A soda-pop, energy drink, or coffee can give you the caffeine you crave, but don't forget to drink water and stay hydrated too! A good strategy is to reuse a clean soda-pop bottle as a water bottle if you forgot to bring one.</p>
  <p>Please help keep other anime lovers safe and enjoy food with common allergens such as peanuts inside the restaurant you got it from.</p>
  <p>It is easy to get wrapped up in Animarathon excitement, but please don't forget any allergies or other medical conditions you might have while ordering food.</p>
  <h2 id="forget">Forgetting Things</h2>
  <p>Everyone forgets things, so don't feel bad if you forgot something. Chances are it's not the end of the world, and you can probably find a replacement from another guest. Failing that Falcon Outfitters on the first floor of the venue carries most basic items you might want including deodorant, toiletries, and cell phone chargers for most major manufacturers. If it is after 5:00PM and Falcon Outfitters has closed, there are some nearby convenience stores off campus that probably carry what you need.</p>
  <p>Sometimes you will forget things at Animarathon. If this happens, contact our lost and found desk on the second floor, and we'll do our best to get your item back to you. If you didn't realize you had lost something until after Animarathon is over, use our contact page to get in touch with us. We might still have it if it was turned in.</p>
