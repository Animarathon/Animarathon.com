  <div class="row">
  <section class="four columns">
  <h2>What should I bring to Animarathon?</h2>

  <h2>When is the panel submission deadline?</h2>
  <p>The panel submission deadline is <time datetime="2007-02-01">February 1st 2017</time>. Your <a rel="nofollow" href="https://goo.gl/forms/uKTjSr0CypobThsp2">panel submission form</a> must be submitted by then for consideration.</p>
  <h2>Why does Animarathon cost money?</h2>
  <p>Even though Animarathon is a student run event, and while BGSU does generously help us with many functions, they can not pay for everything. Renting out the Union, purchasing food, Inviting guests, and hiring security all costs money. In past years we were able to cover our costs with raffle tickets, however as Animarathon grew, some years were were unable to recoup our costs using this method. In order to guarantee our ability to keep hosting Animarathons we had to start charging an admission fee.</p> 
  <p>Keeping Animarathon accessible to everyone is important to us, so we do our bests to keep the admission prices comparatively low, and allow anyone who volunteers for two hours or more to get free admission!</p>
  <h2>When should I wear my badge?</h2>
  <p>While at Animarathon you are encouraged to wear your badge at all times, so it is not lost on accident. However, you might want to remove your badge for several good reasons, such as for photoshoots. The only places where you need a badge are official animarathon events are Panels, Special Event Rooms, The Kawaii Kafe, and the Artists Alley. Wearing your badge in hallways, the food court, and anywhere outside of the Student Union, is not required.</p>
  <h2>Where can I sleep for the night?</h2>
