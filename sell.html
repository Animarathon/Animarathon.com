  <h2>Sell at Artists Alley</h2>
  <p>Starting this year we will <strong>no longer be awarding tables first come first serve basis.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>We are switching to a merit based system instead.</strong> This system uses a special merit algorithm to determine accpetance.</p>
  <p>The application deadline is November 20th, 2017.</p>
  <p>If you are an artist the primary factor governing your acceptance will be the quality of your artwork.</p>
  <p>If you are a merchant the primary factor governing your acceptance will be popularity, quantity, quality, or uniqueness of your merchandise you plan to sell.</p>

  <h1>Seller FAQ</h1>
  <p>Q: What I'm selling isn't unique, should I still apply?</p>
  <p>A: Absolutely! Factors such as guest demand and your own curation are just as important factors as uniqueness of product. Vendors selling things like Anime Disks, Video Games, and other mass produced items are important for the dealers den. Stores without a specific focus are still wanted.</p>
  <p>Q: I'm a new artist, should I still apply?</p>
  <p>A: Yes! Art Quality is hard to measure, but your style as an artist, tone, and medium use all matter in evalutaion. If you want to table, but aren't sure if you would qualify, please give it a shot and apply anyway!</p>
  <p>Q: How is merit determined?</p>
  <p>A: A merit algorithm takes into account various factors such as item popularity, quality, and what other applicants are selling. This helps give variety to customers, and helps to ensure that everyone who is accepted makes more profit then they would otherwise.</p>
