  <h1>Seller FAQ</h1>
  <p>Q: What I'm selling isn't unique, should I still apply?</p>
  <p>A: Absolutely! Factors such as guest demand and your own curation are just as important factors as uniqueness of product. Vendors selling things like Anime Disks, Video Games, and other mass produced items are the bread and butter of artist alley and will not be ignored.</p>
  <p>Q: My art isn't good, should I still apply?</p>
  <p>A: Yes! This isn't to say we're setting the bar low, but some artists are very critical of their own work. If you want to table, but aren't sure if you would qualify, please give it a shot and apply anyway!</p>
  <p>Q: What steps are you taking to ensure that your process is truly based on merit, and not personal bias?</p>
  <p>A: Before selection a non-voting officer will expunge all identifying information (Such as Name, Location, etc) from the applications. Other officers will then review your application. This helps prevent bias from entering the equation.</p>
