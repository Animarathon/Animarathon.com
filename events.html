  <h2 id="kawaii">Kawaii Kafé</h2>
  <p>The Kawaii Cafe is back and better than ever.  This year we will be holding the Kawaii Cafe for one day only! 
      Saturday, March 30th, join us from 1:00 PM - 5:45 PM for some food and entertainment.  
      This year we will be running the cafe in dinner and a show format, so there will be 5, 45 minute time slots to attend throughout the day. 
      Enjoy sushi, desserts, and much more with our super cute maids! 
      There will even be special dance performances and opportunities to take polaroid photos with the maids throughout the day, so you don’t want to miss out.  
      Tickets are only $5, with additional fees for polaroids and items from the bake sale.</p>
  <h2 id="raffle">Raffle</h2>
  <p>The Animarathon Raffle provides a variety of themed prizes. Past Animarathons have provided a variety of prizes including Animes, Mangas, Games, Game consoles, and more!</p>
  <p>Raffle Ticket Sales will be open until 8:30PM on Saturday</p>
  <p>The raffle drawing will be from 9:00PM to 10:00PM Saturday in the Falcons Nest on the First floor of the Union.</p>

  <h2 id="Lolita"> Lolita Tea Party</h2>
  <p>This year at Animarathon, we will be holding our first ever Lolita Tea Party!  It will be held on Sunday, May 31st from 1:00- 3:00.  Admission will be $10 at the door, Cash only.
      Due to the nature of the event, a dress code of proper lolita, aristocrat, ouji is required to attend. 
      Attendees should be wearing lolita style dresses from any designer, with appropriate accessories, petticoats, etc. 
      If you're familiar with Lolita fashion, you'll already know what we mean - if you don't know exactly what we're talking about, this event just might not be for you.   
      We will also accept general j-fashion (i.e. fairy kei, decora, etc)  if you do not own lolita but are interested in the event.  
      The dress code will be enforced at the door, so you must be dressed in proper attire to attend the event.  
      At the tea party we will have various teas, desserts, and more!  
      We will also have a special lolita raffle basket for all attendees (raffle ticket comes with $10 admission) and much more!</p>
    <h2 id="What Lolita"> What is lolita?</h2>
    <p>Lolita is a japanese fashion movement from Harajuku that is influenced by Victorian and Edwardian clothing and styles from the Rococo period. 
      A very distinctive property of Lolita fashion is the modest and royal aesthetic.  The fashion breaks down into several substyles like Gothic, Classic, Sweet, etc.
      This style has evolved into a widely followed subculture in Japan and the rest of the world.  
      The term lolita comes from the japanese word (gosu rori) and is not the same thing as the the Russian novel ‘Lolita’ or the anime trope ‘Lolicon’.  
      The fashion has no sexual or provocative meaning and is simply an rococo inspired fashion style.</p>
